According to Washington State Department of Transport (WSDOT), there wat a total of 10,315 crashes in Seattle city in 2019.  The crashes include 22 fatal car accidents, 190 suspected serious injury collisions, 834 suspected minor injuries, 2612 possible injuries, and 6657 no apparent injuries.  This research mainly focuses on Seattle city of Washington for the period 2004-todate. This traffic safety research, which is based on the data obtained from Seattle Department of Transportation Traffic Management Division, aims not only at prevention but also at reducing the severity of car accident.   Identifying the more probable attributes that greatly contributes to accident severity was given due emphasis in this research."

In this research, attributes like weather condition, road condition, and light condition were considered for accident severity prediction.  The focus was mainly on property damage and physical injury. All irrelevant attributes were dropped, and missing values were retrieved to balance the data set to make it fit into the machine learning algorithm model. The balanced data set was trained on similar instances with respect to severity of car accident. The major factors contributing to car accident include weather condition, light condition and driving under influence.  Of all the factors, weather condition comes first in car accident while light condition and driving under influence come second and third respectively in resulting car accident."

LR involves prediction of a dichotomous dependent variables. It helps predict the probability of car accident severity by fitting the data to a logit function. \n2.\tDecision Tree \u2013 as one of the most popular machine learning algorithms used in data analysis by splitting collision events into two or more similar sets based on the key attributes/ independent variables. It is supervised learning algorithm used for classifying problems. \n3.\tSupport-Vector Machine- it is a method of classification used in this car accident analysis by plotting the raw data as points in an n-dimensional space, where n is the number of features in the data set. The value of each feature was tied to a particular coordinate, making it is easy to classify the data. The classifiers were used to split the data and plot them on the graph.\n4.\tKNN-It is used to solve classification problems in data analysis. It is simple algorithm and stores all available cases and classifies any new cases by taking a majority vote of its k neighbors. The case is therefore assigned to the class with which it has the most in common. A distance function performs this measurement. \n5.\tRandom Forest Classifier-This method is used by collectively looking the decision trees.  To classify a new object based on its attribute, each tree is classified, and the tree \u201cvotes\u2019 for that class. The forest chooses the classification having the most votes.\n"

The prediction performance of all models trained with SMOTE was found out to be more realistic than models trained without SMOTE in this study. The study therefore shows potential of machine learning methods for predicting all-cause fatality using collusion events dataset.   As discussed in the result section of this research, the accuracy is the same for all models used (100 %), The model is overfitted and thus requires to be trained on more data.  "
